        <h2>What is happening?</h2>
        <p>
            You are using an image host that does not get the "approval" needed to be draw to the app. Browsers see it as a potential security risk (even if it is not the case), and mark the canvas as "tainted".
        </p>
        <h2>How does it affect me?</h2>
        <p>
            A "tainted canvas" prevent all sort of automatic save. From then on you must save the card manually by right click it â†’ "Save image as...". It is implying that this action is fully of your concern.<br />
            Furthemore, once it get tainted, it will remains tainted even if you switch to other "safe" image host.
        </p>
        <h2>How do I fix it?</h2>
        <p>
            Change to other safe and popular image host ("imgur" for example) <b>then refresh the page</b>.<br />
            If you cannot afford to do that, the app will also work mostly just fine, you only need to manually save the card (and keep cautious).
